# Galactoscope

Isaac Asimov, Second Foundation (1953): _The Galactoscope is a computing machine extremely complex displaying the night sky as seen from any points of the Galaxy. It can isolate and label with precision 100 millions of stars and let the user naviguate smoothly in all the directions of the galactic field._

Not only we propose to naviguate inside our galaxy, but in the whole Universe! the Galactoscope is based on spark3D, taking benefit from the power of the Apache Spark framework to make dreams come true!
